# Duckest Android App
## Getting Started
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the `gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
Duckest uses Firebase for Auth users. You need to generate google-services.json file from Firebase or you can ask @criterionsz (only for Duckest team and Mr. Tarkhanov)
